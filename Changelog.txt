ChangeLog

	Thanks to github user @abel1502 for this:
		Support inflatable modules from SSPXr and USI

2.0.3.1
	Thanks to github user @TuckMeIntoBread for this:
		 Fixes issue where staging fails to function correctly if a player deploys a vessel and exits the game before actually loading into that vessel
2.0.3
	Thanks to github user @RadHazard for these changes
		The list of mission profiles highlights the cost in green, and also shows cost per ton (useful for construction missions)
		The mission profile list is now sorted by name (and updates when profiles are renamed)
		Transport profiles are no longer shown when picking a mission profile for a Deploy mission, and vice-versa
		Profiles of the right type but not valid for a mission (e.g. because the payload is too heavy) are hidden by default, but can be shown with a checkbox
		The list of profiles can be searched by name (either profile name or craft name)
		Both the payload search and profile search are now case-insensitive
		Add cost per ton to the profile screen
